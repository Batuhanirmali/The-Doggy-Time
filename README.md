## 🐶 The Doggy Time
**I started The Doggy Time app to learn how to upload apps to the AppStore to consolidate what I've learned so far and create a good reference in my portfolio, and I love dogs. Therefore, in my application, I wanted to provide information about useful vegetables and fruits that dogs can eat, dog name suggestions and purposeful dog breeds that you can keep at home or in your garden.**
